# Yurei Dark Theme

## A low saturation (really) dark theme

A dark theme tailored for those who like low saturated colors and indigo/purple.

As the previous line implies, this is an stealth dark theme with indigo accents.

## Random trivia

Technicaly the name of the theme should be *Yūrei*, but I went with Yurei to prevent weird ascii errors.

> Yūrei (幽霊) are figures in Japanese folklore analogous to the Western model of ghosts. The name consists of two kanji, 幽 (yū), meaning "faint" or "dim" and 霊 (rei), meaning "soul" or "spirit". Alternative names include 亡霊 (Bōrei), meaning ruined or departed spirit, 死霊 (Shiryō) meaning dead spirit, or the more encompassing 妖怪 (Yōkai) or お化け (Obake). Like their Chinese, Korean and Western counterparts, they are thought to be spirits barred from a peaceful afterlife.

So yeah, ghost theme!

Perfect for halloween lovers or goths, I guess.
